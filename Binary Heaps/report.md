# Activity 9: Binary Heaps

## Tasks

Draw what the following heap would look like after we insert the value 11 into it: 
            11
         /       \
        9         10
      /   \     /    \
     6     5   7      4
   /  \   /
  2   1  3



Draw what the previous heap would look like after we delete the root node. 
            10
         /       \
        9         7
      /   \     /    \
     6     5   3      4
   /  \   /
  2   1  

Imagine youâ€™ve built a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. 
If you then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert the numbers into a new array, in what order would the numbers now appear?

[99, 68, 55, 34, 22, 10, 2]
