Imagine youâ€™ve built a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. 
If you then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert the numbers into a new array, in what order would the numbers now appear?

[99, 68, 55, 34, 22, 10, 2]
